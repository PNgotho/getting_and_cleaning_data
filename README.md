# getting_and_cleaning_data
This repo is for my project on Getting and Cleaning Data

Data sources used were downloaded from the link https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
The zip file was unzipped on local PC and all content placed in the Data folder of the repo. Some of the files are large and could cause challenge on commiting to repo.
To try out the code on this repo you may need to download your own copy of the zip file and unzip it in your PC incase the data set in the repo is corrupted due to the size.

To understand the source data sets review the README.md file located in the Data folder of this repo.

The following are the instructions given for this project which is the basis of work done in this repo.

Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
